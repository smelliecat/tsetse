class SGDSolver:
    """
    Implements the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization algorithm.
    
    Algorithm Description:
    SGD updates each parameter (W) based on the gradient (G) of the objective function 
    with respect to that parameter. The formula for the parameter update is:
    
    W = W - lr * mean(G)
    
    where lr is the learning rate and mean(G) is the mean of the gradients.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate (float): Learning rate.
    - modules (List): List of layers in the model, excluding the input layer. 
                       All layers should have a parent class of LinearLayer.
